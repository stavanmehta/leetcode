 * Total Submissions: 27.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n2'
 *
 * Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
 * 
 * Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only
 * 1s. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 * Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
 * underlined.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: 
 * [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
 * Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is
 * underlined.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 20000
 * 0 <= K <= A.length
 * A[i] is 0 or 1 
 *
